# Game Of Life - Raylib Implementation

A C++ implementation of **Conwayâ€™s Game of Life**, built using the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) graphics library.

--- 

## Rules of the game
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
